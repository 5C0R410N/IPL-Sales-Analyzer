Technical Development Support:

Special recognition for technical development assistance, debugging, and optimization support provided by:

- **DeepSeek** (from depth.so): For comprehensive AI assistance throughout the coding process, including troubleshooting Cython/Python integration issues, optimizing the parser for pages 339-345, and refining the user interface for better terminal compatibility.

- **Qwen** (from Alibaba Cloud): For valuable AI collaboration in the initial project planning and architectural design phase, helping to establish the smart Cython/Python fallback system.

Technical Features:

This application represents dedicated work to create a tool that is both powerful and reliable. The smart fallback system ensures operation regardless of the environment, while Cython optimization provides enhanced performance when available.

The primary goal was to create a practical solution that genuinely assists with daily sales analysis work, rather than being merely a technical demonstration.
